This project tries to build a small 2D jump and run.

It is using images and other things from my old Java game *Tuff*.

The game code itself is written in Lua and engine underneath is implemented in C with the help of Allegro 5.

Most of the code is licensed under MIT (including the AABB lua class!) but some of the Tuff things are GPL.


__How to Build__

> Right now this pretty much only compiles on Linux.

Make sure to install Allegro 5 (either via a package or from source) and Lua 5.

Now running the Makefile should somehow work I guess.
